       Geralt was born in 1174 as the son of the sorceress Visenna and presumably the warrior Korin. Shortly after his birth, his mother left him at the School of The Wolf in the stronghold of Kaer Morhen where he was made and trained to become a Witcher. As a child, he was subjected to the Trial of The Grasses, (of which only 3 out of 10 survive). Geralt survived the many blistering mutations required to grant Witchers their abilities. After displaying unusual tolerance, Geralt was selected to further experimental mutations which granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain. Geralt was the only witcher to survive these experiments. This resulted in his hair turning white and received the nickname ‘White Wolf’.<br>
         He was trained by his mentor Vesemir whom he came to regard as a father-figure. Geralt underwent many years of rigorous training with one infamous obstacle course known as ‘The Pendulum’. He soon met his fellow classmate Eskel and the two became good friends, almost as close as brothers. One time they captured a large forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. The pair laughed at its antics until they were discovered by Vesmeir who punished them with a leather strap. He also befriended Lambert and Coën. As young witcher's were encouraged to make surnames for themselves in the interest of appearing trustworthy towards their clients, Geralt initially chose the name "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde" however this was regarded as silly and pretentious by Vesemir, and so instead he chose the name 'Rivia' and even adopted a Rivian accent to make himself sound more authentic. Geralt also spent time training with Mother Nenneke at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander.

                  <p class="Ciri-text">Full name - Cirilla Fiona Helen Rhiannon, she is also known as Falka, the Lion of Cintra, the Swallow, the Lady of the Lake, Zirael. Ciri is the daughter of Princess Pavetta and the Duke of Dani (under this name the crown prince of the Nilfgaard Empire Emgar var Emreis was hidden), the granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. The fantasy saga has its own mythical reckoning, according to which Ciri was born in May 1252. Cirilla's parents went missing during a storm at sea. After they began to be considered dead, Ciri became the heir to the throne, queen of Cintra, princess of Brugge and Sodden. Ciri's genealogy is traced in the book Baptism by Fire, which states that Elder Blood (elven blood) flows in her veins.<br>
       According to legend, in ancient times covered with gray hair there was a country called Cirillia, where only elves, kobolds and dwarves lived, who had nothing to share. Elves lived in the forests and on the plains, kobolds and gnomes lived in the mountains. And then people came, or rather fled to Cyril, moving away from the threat of complete extermination. They were unable to cope with the forces of Evil in their native land and therefore moved to Cirillia. For kobolds and dwarves, the aliens did not cause much trouble. Soon enough calm relations were established between them and people, which no one sought to spoil.</p>

          <p class="Yennefer-text">Yennefer was born in Vengerberg, the capital of the kingdom of Aedirn, in Belletane in 1173. The woman is a hunchback from birth, and her parents give the girl to the school of sorceresses in Arethusa for education and training in magic, since they do not see the prospect of marrying her because of her deformity. The enchantress Tissaya de Vries, after a suicide attempt, Yennefer takes her as an apprentice. In the course of studying at the Yen school, defects in appearance are corrected, because the prestige of the profession requires it. The book mentions that her high school friend was Sabrina Glevissig.<br>
       
       Having become a sorceress, Yennefer opens a private practice in her house in Vengerberg, including providing medical assistance to women in the treatment of infertility or helping them terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Yennefer, like most sorceresses, could not have children. Wanting to have a child at any cost, she tries to use the possibilities of the genie freed by Buttercup, and subsequently takes part in an unsuccessful hunt for the golden dragon.
